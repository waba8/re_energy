# MongoDB Persistent Context Sprint Hackathon 2026 **Participant Guide**

Welcome to [The Persistent Context Sprint Hackathon](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/persistent-context-sprint-hackathon)! 👋 We’re thrilled to have you on board. This guide is your all-in-one resource for the event, including schedule, rules, technical resources, problem statements, judging information, and more. Please read this carefully; most answers can be found here.

## **1️⃣ Your Goal**

**No Cold Start**

Every agent starts from nothing. Build one that doesn't. Use MongoDB to hold state, memory, and live application data so your agent comes back with what it learned last time instead of relearning everything. What you store, retrieve, and checkpoint should change what the system does next, not just fill the prompt.

Example Projects:

- An agent that tracks which retrieval strategies actually worked (chunk size, reranking, source weights, k values) and adapts future runs based on outcome scores stored in MongoDB.
- A coding agent that keeps repo conventions and past fixes in Atlas, retrieves them via vector search on new tasks, and checkpoints through LangGraph so a crash mid-refactor doesn't lose progress
- A multi-agent system that shares context through MongoDB, discovers capabilities via vector search, and coordinates through change streams so handoffs carry state forward

We recommend familiarizing yourself with MongoDB's [MCP Server](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/mcp-server) and [Agent Skills](https://github.com/mongodb/agent-skills) to start building quickly.

The **Best Project Built with ElevenLabs** prize will be awarded based off the following criteria:

- **Agentic Depth:** Does the project go beyond simple text-to-speech? We prioritize autonomous agents that handle complex logic and real-time dialogue.

- **Interaction Design:** How lifelike is the experience? We value projects that master low-latency response times and emotional inflection.

- **Technical Integration:** Creative use of the ElevenLabs API - especially multimodal implementations (Voice + Video) or clever prompt engineering for the Agent’s personality.

- **Novelty:** A use case we haven’t seen before that solves a real-world problem using conversational AI.

## **6️⃣ MongoDB Provided Resources**

MongoDB has provided the following resources to guide you during the hackathon:

This hackathon focuses on building AI applications with agent memory: systems that retain context over time and take action on real data, including databases, documents, code, and other business systems.

### Recommended Starting Point

Participants are encouraged to configure the following three resources before beginning development. Together, they provide an AI coding assistant with the context, connectivity, and prompting guidance needed to work effectively with MongoDB.

- [**MongoDB Agent Skills**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/agent-skills/) — A set of instructions that can be installed into an AI coding assistant (such as Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot) to provide it with MongoDB best practices for connecting to a database, structuring data, writing queries, and implementing search.

- [**MongoDB MCP Server**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mcp-server/get-started/) — Enables an AI coding assistant to connect directly to a live MongoDB database to inspect data, run queries, retrieve counts, and manage Atlas resources.

- [**Natural Language to MongoDB Queries**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/natural-language-to-mongodb/) — Guidance on how to prompt an AI assistant effectively, including what details to provide about the desired task, data structure, and output format.

**Recommended sequence:** install Agent Skills, connect the MCP Server, and reference the prompting guide throughout development.

### Data and Search

- [**Sample Movie Dataset**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix) — A ready-to-use dataset that can be loaded in minutes and is preconfigured for AI-powered search.

- [**Data Modeling in MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/#data-modeling) — Best practices for structuring data for efficient use by applications and AI agents.

- [**Vector Search**](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search) — Enables search based on semantic meaning rather than exact keyword matches, forming the basis for long-term, retrievable agent memory.

- [**Atlas Search**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/) — Provides fast, typo-tolerant keyword search capabilities.

- [**Automated Embeddings**](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/product-release-announcements/unlocking-ai-search-introducing-automated-embedding-in-mongodb-vector-search) — Generates and maintains vector embeddings within the database, removing the need for a separate embedding pipeline.

- [**Embedding and Reranking API**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-embedding-and-reranking-api/) — A single endpoint for embedding and reranking operations, accessible from any application or technology stack.

### Memory and Agents

- [**Building an Agent with Memory and Function Calling**](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/interactive-rag-mongodb-atlas-function-calling-api/) — An example of an agent that retains context and executes functions to act on data, closely aligned with the hackathon's theme.

- [**Adding Memory to a Chat Application (Python)**](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/advanced-rag-langchain-mongodb/) — Demonstrates how to maintain context across a conversation using LangChain and MongoDB Atlas.

- [**Adding Memory to a Chat Application (JavaScript)**](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/add-memory-to-javascript-rag-application-mongodb-langchain/) — The same approach implemented in JavaScript.

### State

[**Build an AI Agent with LangGraph and MongoDB Atlas**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/ai-integrations/langgraph/build-agents/) — A practical example using thread-specific checkpoints and conversation persistence.

[**State & Persistence: The Problem of Agent Reliability**](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/technical/state-persistence-the-problem-of-agent-reliability) — A deeper look at checkpoints, suspend/resume, crash recovery, and where state ends and memory begins.

### Context

[**Build AI Agents with MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/ai-agents/) — Agents that use MongoDB for retrieval alongside APIs and external tools.

[**GraphRAG with MongoDB and LangChain**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/ai-integrations/langchain/graph-rag/) — Ingest external documents and retrieve relationship-aware context.

### Starter Code

- [**GenAI Showcase**](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/GenAI-Showcase/tree/main) — A comprehensive library of example applications spanning multiple AI frameworks and programming languages.

- [**MongoDB and Python Quickstart**](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mongodb-atlas-python-quickstart/blob/main/quickstart-1-getting-started-atlas-python.ipynb) — An introductory guide for building with MongoDB Atlas and Python.

- [**MERN Starter Application**](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mern-stack-example) — A starter project using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## **8️⃣ Submission Process**

Teams should submit [**here**](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/persistent-context-sprint-hackathon/submit) when they have completed hacking. In the submission form, **you will have to submit a short one minute demo video**. This should be a video highlighting the specific features, code, and functionality that your team built during the hackathon.

Please double check that your repository is public, your demo link is accessible, and all team members have been added to the submission page.

Check your inbox for an email with a link to your **Atlas Hackathon Sandbox**, and create your project + cluster through it. **Your hackathon build must live in this sandbox to be eligible for the finalist round**.

## **9️⃣ Judging Process**

Judging will take place in two rounds.

**Round One:** Judging happens asynchronously. Every team submits a short demo video and a link to their public repo, and judges review submissions on their own time and score them against the criteria below:

> **Impact Potential (20%)** — What is the project’s long-term potential for success? Will this project have a long-lasting impact on the industry, world, or any other areas? How useful and substantial is this project beyond the scope of the hackathon?
> ****Live Demo (20%)** — How well has the team implemented their core idea? Does it work well live? How is it presented?
> ****Technologies Used (25%)** — How effectively does the project incorporate MongoDB technologies and features? Does the team also make meaningful use of partner tools and APIs (ElevenLabs, LangChain, OpenRouter, Fireworks)? We're looking for thoughtful, functional integration where these technologies are core to how the project works.
> ****Creativity and Originality (35%)** — Has this concept been seen before? In what ways does this project differentiate itself, and what innovations does it bring to its respective field? Does it tackle the problem statements in a unique way?

**Round Two:** The top six teams demo live on stage in front of all attendees, with \~3 minutes to demo followed by 1-2 minutes of Q&A. The winner is decided by a live audience vote held after all six demos. The same criteria as above will be used, though with equal weighting for each category.
